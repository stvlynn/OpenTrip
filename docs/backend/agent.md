# Trip agent

The non-intrusive AI companion described in
[../decisions/0005-trip-agent.md](../decisions/0005-trip-agent.md). One shared
session per trip; every member talks in the same timeline, and the agent stays
quiet unless asked or a change carries a material planning risk.

## Session model

- `agent_messages` is the single timeline per trip: member chat, `@agent`
  mentions, operation events (`source = operation`), and agent replies.
  Stop-comment `@agent` threads use `source = stop_comment` and are rendered
  in StopDetail (not the agent drawer); the ambient reply is also persisted
  on the stop as a comment with `author = agent`.
- `agent_suggestions` stores AI-proposed patches with `status`
  (`pending | applied | stale | expired`), the model's `severity`/`confidence`/
  `reason`, and the `trip_version` the patch was computed against.
- `agent_suggestion_dismissals` hides a suggestion's toast per user; the shared
  record and other members' toasts are unaffected.
- `trips.version` is bumped by every persisted mutation
  (`PgTripRepository`), so an apply can detect that a patch went stale.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit chat with `@agent` | `POST …/agent/chat` | Streams a reply (AI SDK UI message stream). User and assistant rows are persisted with the **same UIMessage ids** the client `useChat` buffer uses, so the panel can dedupe live vs history while streaming. Write tools are available (with approval). |
| Agent-thread follow-up (e.g. “确认”) | `POST …/agent/chat` (client) | The web client routes short confirmations and other continuations after an assistant turn to the same streaming chat path so write tools can run. Without this, ambient replies are read-only and cannot `insertStop`. |
| Plain member message | `POST …/agent/messages` | Persists the message, then asks whether the agent was addressed (thread follow-ups after an agent turn count; explicit `@agent` or an AI-judged ask also). Ambient reply runs in the background (lands via polling); pure member-to-member chatter stays silent. Ambient replies use **read tools only**. |
| `@agent` or `@Member` in a stop comment | `POST …/stops/:stopId/comments` | Mirrored into the shared session with the stop as context (`source = stop_comment`). `@Member` mentions populate `mentionedUserIds` so the same client toast path as chat fires. Ambient agent reply runs **only** when `@agent` is present; the reply is written into that stop's comment thread (`author = agent`) and is **not** shown in the agent drawer |
| Whitelisted write operation | stop insert/update/move, day update/delete/reorder, expense add/update | Recorded as an operation event, then evaluated asynchronously |

## Intervention policy

Operation evaluation uses `generateObject` with a structured
`InterventionDecision` schema (`shouldNotify`, `severity`, `confidence`,
`reason`, `suggestion`, `pendingPatch`, `expiresInMinutes`). The system prompt
restricts notifications to material risks: impossible timing, duplicate or
conflicting stops, weather/season conflicts, avoidable backtracking, and
inconsistent budget entries.

- `shouldNotify && confidence >= AI_PROACTIVE_THRESHOLD && pendingPatch` →
  an assistant message plus a `pending` suggestion; members see a toast via
  polling.
- `shouldNotify` below the threshold → a quiet observation line in the
  timeline, no toast.
- Otherwise → nothing.

`PendingPatch` is a discriminated union limited to operations the Trip
aggregate already supports: `update_stop`, `move_stop`, `update_day`,
`reorder_days`, `update_expense`.

### Chat tools (Vercel AI SDK)

Write tools are **generated** from the trip ops registry
([trip-ops.md](./trip-ops.md)) — not hand-listed in the AI adapter. Adding a
trip CRUD op means extending `TRIP_OPS` once; agent tools, `toolApproval`, and
proactive `pendingPatch` stay in sync.

| Tool | Approval | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `checkWeather` | none (auto) | Read forecast via `WeatherService` (same as `GET /api/weather`; not in trip ops registry). See [weather.md](./weather.md) |
| `placeSearch` | none (auto) | Free-text place search via `GeoService` |
| `placeNearby` | none (auto) | Nearby POIs via `GeoService` |
| `placeDetail` | none (auto) | Place enrichment via `GeoService` |
| `routeCompute` | none (auto) | Route between waypoints via `GeoService` |
| `routeMatrix` | none (auto) | Travel-time matrix via `GeoService` |
| `reviewLookup` | none (auto) | Place reviews when the geo provider supports them |
| `airbnbSearch` | none (auto) | Airbnb vacation-rental search via `LodgingService` |
| `airbnbListingDetails` | none (auto) | Airbnb listing amenities/rules/description |
| `readTripMedia` | none (auto) | Read a trip-owned upload (image/PDF/text) via AI SDK `toModelOutput`; URL must be this trip’s `/api/uploads/trips/…` path |
| *(from registry)* | `user-approval` | All trip-scoped editor mutations (`renameTrip`, `insertStop`, …) |

Geo and lodging tools are read-only and do not mutate trips. Adding a discovered
place or stay still uses `insertStop` (and approval). Provider selection and
caching for geo are documented in [geo.md](./geo.md); lodging (Airbnb scrape) in
[lodging.md](./lodging.md).

### Itinerary planning workflow

When a member asks the agent to create or fill a multi-day plan, the chat
system prompt requires:

1. **Research with tools** — `placeSearch` / `placeNearby` / `placeDetail` for
   sights and food, `airbnbSearch` for lodging, `checkWeather` for dates,
   routes when travel time matters. Do not invent POIs without tools.
2. **Draft + ask** — present a day-by-day proposal and ask whether to write it
   into the trip (e.g. reply “确认”). No write tools on that proposal turn.
3. **Confirm → write** — on member confirmation, call `updateDay` /
   `insertStop` (Stay / Sight / Food, etc.) with coords and names from tool
   results; approval UI still gates each write. Put estimated prices (tickets,
   lodging, meals) in the stop **note**, not via `addExpense`. Only call
   `addExpense` when the member explicitly asks to record a spend.

`AI_MAX_TOOL_STEPS` defaults to 16 so a multi-day plan can finish research and
writes in one turn.

### Multimodal (AI SDK file parts)

- Members can attach **PNG / JPEG / WebP / PDF / plain text** (markdown, csv)
  in the agent composer (max 2 MiB, same as trip note media).
- Files are uploaded to `POST /api/trips/:id/media` first; chat messages persist
  AI SDK `{ type: "file", mediaType, url, filename? }` parts (never `data:` URLs).
- Before calling the model, trip-owned upload URLs are resolved to **inline
  bytes** via `FileStorage` (and `experimental_download` for any remaining URL
  parts). AI SDK’s default HTTP downloader blocks `localhost`/private hosts
  (SSRF guard); we never ask it to fetch our own upload URLs over the network.
- Stop `note` Markdown (truncated) is included in the trip snapshot so the agent
  can discover existing upload URLs and call `readTripMedia` when needed.
- External URLs are rejected by `readTripMedia` and by the custom download
  helper (SSRF protection).

Write tools use AI SDK `toolApproval` + `experimental_toolApprovalSecret`. The
client continues with `addToolApprovalResponse({ id, approved, reason? })` and
`sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses`.
`execute` calls `applyTripOp` → Trip aggregate + repository.

Ambient threshold replies use **read tools only** (no approval loop) and a
**separate ambient system prompt** so the model is not told it has write tools.
That prompt must not claim tools are “broken/unavailable”; if a write is needed
it asks the member to continue with `@agent`. The web client therefore sends
agent-thread follow-ups (confirmations, short continuations) through
`POST …/agent/chat` so write tools remain available.
Every plain member message is still evaluated with `isAddressed` for ambient
replies when the client uses `POST …/messages`. Continuations of an agent turn
— short confirmations like “确认”, choices, or follow-up questions right after
an assistant message — are treated as addressed even without `@agent`
(deterministic heuristic first, then the model). There is no message-count
threshold.

There is no product API for deleting a stop or expense yet. Invites and votes
stay human-only. Stop comments are human-authored except for agent replies that
land in the same thread after an explicit `@agent` mention.

## Approving a suggestion

Proactive suggestions use the same approval DTO as AI SDK tools:

```json
{ "id": "<suggestionId>", "approved": true, "reason": "optional" }
```

`POST …/suggestions/:id/approve` with `approved: true` runs
`applySuggestion` through the normal domain path:

1. `loadEditable` — membership + edit permission (viewers get `403`).
2. Reject non-pending (`409`), expired (`409`, marked `expired`), and
   version-mismatched suggestions (`409`, marked `stale`).
3. Claim with `UPDATE … WHERE status = 'pending'` so concurrent applies are
   first-come-first-served.
4. Execute the patch via the Trip aggregate and repository (which bumps
   `trips.version`), then record the approve in the session. The write is
   attributed to the approving user.

`approved: false` dismisses the toast for that user only (same as legacy
dismiss). `POST …/apply` and `…/dismiss` remain as aliases.

## Architecture

- Domain: `apps/api/src/domain/agent/` — types plus the
  `AgentSessionRepository` and `AgentModel` ports.
- Application: `apps/api/src/application/agent/agent-service.ts` — use cases,
  permission checks mirroring `TripService`, and the apply/conflict rules.
- Infrastructure: `apps/api/src/infrastructure/ai/agent-model.ai-sdk.ts`
  (Vercel AI SDK adapter; OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible via `AI_BASE_URL`, or
  MiniMax via Anthropic-compatible API when `AI_PROVIDER=minimax`) and
  `apps/api/src/infrastructure/persistence/agent-repository.pg.ts` (raw `pg`).
- Interfaces: agent sub-router in `apps/api/src/interfaces/http/app.ts`;
  routes return `404` when AI is not configured. Post-response work
  (evaluations, ambient replies, stream persistence) uses
  `executionCtx.waitUntil` on Workers and a floating promise on Node.

## Configuration

Set in the root `.env` (see [.env.example](../../.env.example)); the agent is
disabled unless both `AI_MODEL` and `AI_API_KEY` are present.

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `minimax`, or a label for OpenAI-compatible | `openai` |
| `AI_MODEL` | Model id (required), e.g. `MiniMax-M2.7` | — |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | Provider base URL. Empty: OpenAI API, or MiniMax `…/anthropic/v1` when `AI_PROVIDER=minimax` | — |
| `AI_API_KEY` | API key (required) | — |
| `AI_PROACTIVE_THRESHOLD` | Minimum confidence for a proactive suggestion | `0.7` |
| `AI_MAX_TOOL_STEPS` | Tool-step cap per chat generation | `16` |

### MiniMax

Set `AI_PROVIDER=minimax` and `AI_MODEL` to a supported id (`MiniMax-M2.7`,
`MiniMax-M3`, …). Leave `AI_BASE_URL` empty to use
`https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic/v1` (Anthropic-compatible). That path
streams `thinking` blocks as AI SDK `reasoning` parts so the panel can render
them in `AgentReasoning`.

`@ai-sdk/anthropic` appends `/messages` to `baseURL`, so the prefix **must**
include `/v1` (same default as
[vercel-minimax-ai-provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/minimax):
`https://api.minimax.io/anthropic/v1`). A bare `…/anthropic` value is normalized
to `…/anthropic/v1`. Using a generic OpenAI-compatible MiniMax URL mixes
thinking into plain text and does not produce separate reasoning chunks.

For `MiniMax-M3`, the adapter sends
`providerOptions.anthropic.thinking = { type: "adaptive" }` (M3 defaults
thinking off). M2.x models always emit thinking.

See [MiniMax AI SDK docs](https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/api-reference/text-ai-sdk)
and the [AI SDK MiniMax provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers/minimax).

On Cloudflare, set the same variables as Worker vars/secrets (see
[../operations/cloudflare.md](../operations/cloudflare.md)).

## Frontend

The planner page hosts the panel (see
[../frontend/layers.md](../frontend/layers.md)): a sparkle toggle in the
top-right corner mirroring the left sidebar control, a right agent panel (a
`bg-sidebar` base layer mirroring the left sidebar, revealed by a width
transition) with `useChat` + `DefaultChatTransport` for streaming (full message list so tool
approvals round-trip), a 12-second poll of `GET …/agent/events` shared by all
members, and bottom-right intervention cards with approve / discuss / deny
actions (AI SDK approval DTO). Chat tool parts render Approve/Deny via
`addToolApprovalResponse`. Plain (non-`@agent`) sends use
`POST …/agent/messages`, which returns the inserted `message`; the SPA merges
it with `setQueryData` so the bubble appears immediately without relying on a
list GET that may hit a stale Hyperdrive cache (same write-echo rule as trip
create — [../frontend/data-caching.md](../frontend/data-caching.md)). Approved
write tools return `{ ok, summary, trip }` (in-memory `TripDto`, not a
re-`SELECT`); the SPA applies `trip` via `setQueryData` and must **not**
`invalidateQueries(trip)` after stream settle or agent-events polls — that
path was wiping freshly added stops in production. Avatars resolve members by
`actorUserId` (not display name) so duplicate names stay distinct. The
collapsed state persists via
`PUT /api/users/preferences/agent-panel` (response is the written preference
snapshot — not a post-write re-read; see
[../operations/cloudflare.md](../operations/cloudflare.md#hyperdrive-read-after-write)).

On Workers, Better Auth and `SqlAgentSessionRepository` use the
`HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED` binding (`poolFresh`) so history/events polls see
fresh rows after writes. Deferred ambient replies **and** streaming chat
`onFinish` persistence are tracked on the container and finish before
`pool.end()` (`disposeAfterDeferred`). Without holding the pool for the SSE
lifetime, `appendMessage` fails with `Cannot use a pool after calling end on
the pool` and the SPA clears the live buffer — the reply appears to vanish.
